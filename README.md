## 📌 Project Overview

Customer support teams receive hundreds or thousands of tickets daily, making manual categorization and prioritization inefficient and error-prone. This project addresses that challenge by building an **NLP-powered Support Ticket Classification System** that:

* Automatically classifies incoming support tickets
* Assigns urgency-based priority levels
* Presents results through a professional, enterprise-style web interface

The system enables support teams to **respond faster, route tickets intelligently, and improve customer satisfaction**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Manual handling of customer support tickets often leads to:

* ❌ Delayed responses
* ❌ Poor prioritization of critical issues
* ❌ Increased customer dissatisfaction

This project leverages **Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning** to automate ticket understanding and urgency assessment in real time.

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach

The project follows a production-style machine learning workflow:

1. Generate a large-scale dataset of realistic support tickets (10,000+)
2. Perform text preprocessing and feature extraction
3. Train a supervised ML classifier for ticket categorization
4. Assign priority using rule-based logic layered over ML predictions
5. Deploy the system as a Flask web application
6. Present results using a clean, professional UI

## 📂 Dataset Description

* **Dataset Size:** 10,000+ support tickets
* **Categories:** Technical, Billing, Account, General
* **Dataset Type:** Synthetic but business-realistic
* **Purpose:** Training and evaluating ticket classification model

The dataset was programmatically generated to simulate real-world customer support traffic.

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

* **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
* **Feature Extraction:** TF-IDF Vectorization
* **Reason for Selection:**

  * Fast training on large text datasets
  * Interpretable and production-friendly
  * Suitable for real-time classification

---

## 🚦 Priority Assignment Logic

| Priority | Criteria                                                 |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| High     | Service outage, payment failure, refund, critical errors |
| Medium   | Partial issues, delays, billing inconsistencies          |
| Low      | Informational queries, appreciation, general questions   |

This hybrid approach combines **ML intelligence with business rules**, mirroring real enterprise systems.
